# WelcomeCookiePhonebook
This AJAX project has a welcome cookie that recognizes a user and allows a reset of the cookie if the person is not the same user.

Objective:
Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and an XML document. Your HTML document should use a welcome cookie. 
This means that you will have to create code to set this cookie the first time the user visits the page. 
You should display text on the webpage to welcome the user to the page, and there should be a button or link that can be clicked to re-set the cookie if the user is different from the one for which the cookie is currently set. 
For example, you page might include something like this:Â 

Welcome Back, Susan!
